# Image-classification-application
AI algorithms are incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. 

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. [This dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) concist tens or hundreds observations of  102 flower categories

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Loading and preprocessing the image datasets
* Training  image classifier on the datasets
* Using the trained classifier to predict image content

This project implemented in Python with PyTorch framework
The endpoint of this project is an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images and deployed.
